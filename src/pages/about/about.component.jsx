                Hi there! I am <strong>&nbsp;Gustavo Torres Díaz.</strong>
                A passionate programmer and biotechnologist, born and brought up in Perú.
                I am a Full stack Web and Mobile Developer, responsible, perseverant, easy to work
                in team, committed and creative.
                <br />
                In 2017, I successfully completed my Biotechnological Engineering career.
                <br />
                And in 2020 I sucessfully finished my career in Software Design and Systems Integration.
                <br />
                I would like to join a software development team where I can continue to learn and grow professionally
                applying all the knowledge acquired in management, biotechnology and software development during my
                formative years.
                <br />I am passionate about the new technologies that come out day by day as Machine Learning and Bioinformatics,
                and being able to be at the forefront with these.
                <br /> <br />
